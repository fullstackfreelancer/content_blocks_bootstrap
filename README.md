# TYPO3 Content Blocks for Bootstrap

This extension provides a collection of content blocks for the Bootstrap framework, based on the "content_blocks" extension. The content blocks can also be copied and used in other projects.

## Important Note!

The extension is in beta testing and is not yet intended for use in live websites. It requires a theme or site package with the Bootstrap 5 framework.
