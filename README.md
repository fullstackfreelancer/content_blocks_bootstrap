# TYPO3 Content Blocks for Bootstrap

This extension provides a collection of content blocks for the Bootstrap framework, based on the "content_blocks" extension. The content blocks can also be copied and used in other projects.

## Important Note!

The extension is in beta testing and is not yet intended for use in live websites. It requires a theme or site package with the Bootstrap 5 framework.

## Available Content Elements

| Name  | Identifier | Description
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Accordion  | bootstrap_accordion  | Providing simple inline records with title and text (RTE). Will be extended in the future. |
| Alert  | bootstrap_alert  | Simple alert with theme color selector and dismissible checkbox |
| Card  | bootstrap_card  | Card with title, text (RTE) and image on top/bottom/no image |
| Image/s  | bootstrap_image  | Single image or set of images. Number of columns per breakpoint configurable. |
